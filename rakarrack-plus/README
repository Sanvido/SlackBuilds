rakarrack-plus (realtime audio effects processor for JACK)

This project is a merging of original rakarrack (http://rakarrack.sourceforge.net)
and the program's effects ported to LV2 from (https://github.com/ssj71/rkrlv2).
In addition there are many bug fixes and enhancements to rakarrack and the LV2s.
Rakarrack-plus-1.0.0 is the first version under the new name.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
